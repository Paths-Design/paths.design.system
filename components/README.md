# Paths design tokens

This folder holds the design tokens for the Paths Design system. All of our tokens are stored in a single input file.

This is managed directly by our design team in figma, which follows an approval process set by our team.

1. Design indicates that a token, or token set is ready to be added to the system.
2. Our team plans and tickets a push to the system.
